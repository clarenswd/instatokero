# Instagram Access-token generator

This code is for quick fixes. There should and I believe there is a better way to do this. 

##Requirements
1. A Client app [create it here](https://www.instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/)
2. A Client ID, you will get it once you create the app.
3. SETUP your redirect URLs (in your client app, also when you copy the url into the code, it needs to match 100%) 
4. A Web server, MAMP or Python -m SimpleHTTPServer, let it run on port 80, if you set http://localhost.
5. Update the code, index.php, run it, get the TOken and go home.
